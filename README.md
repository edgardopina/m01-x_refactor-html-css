## Description

This project consisted of refactoring existing code of a basic web page created with [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) and [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) styling. The main refactoring tasks included:

- [Search Engine Optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization)

   - Added [meta](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta/name) elements to provide website description, keywords, and author.
   - Added meaningful [title](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/title) element to define the document's title that is shown in a browser's title bar or a page's tab.

- [Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/)

   - Replaced generic [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) elements with semantic elements to improve the website's accessibility compliance: [header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/header), [nav](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/nav), [section](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/section), [article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article), [footer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/footer).
   - Added [alt](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img) attribute to all [img](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img) elements.
   - Confirmed proper sequence of heading elements: h1, h2, h3, etc.
- Fixed incomplete tags
- Added styling and formatting to the navigation menu.
